    Any board-specific config settings should be placed in individual

    BOARD SELECTION

    Because several boards use this code library with sometimes slightly
    different pin configuration, you will need to specify which board you
    are using by enabling one of the following definitions. The code base
    will then try to configure itself accordingly for that board.

    GNU Toolchain
    -------------
    If you are using make, the target board is specified in the makefile

    Crossworks for ARM
    ------------------
    The board is selected as an additional defined in the solution
    properties window, in the 'Common' group under 'Preprocessor Options >
    Preprocessor Definitions'

    LPCXpresso/Red Suite
    --------------------
    Each board has it's own 'Build Configuration', which can be accessed
    by right-clicking on your project, and selecting the 'Build
    Configurations > Set Active ... > BUILD_CONFIG' menu

    Keil uVision
    ------------
    Select a board via the project 'Options' dialogue box, in the C/C++
    tab, entering an appropriate value in the 'Define' textbox
